## Description📽️

This project is a movie review and anime chat web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can submit reviews that are added to the page using DOM manipulation and HTML templates. The app includes interactive features such as like buttons, live-updating timestamps, and browser-based alerts to enhance user experience.

## Objectives

- Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.
- Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application.
- Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
- Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

## Instructions

You will create a small single-page web application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!

Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.

Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.

Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.

Since topic and content are secondary to functionality for this assessment, we have included some resources below for free content that you can use to populate your application. Once you have gotten your functionality in place, you can return and fill in the content with something interesting.

## Checklist

- Cache at least one element using selectElementByld. ✅

- Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAlL ✅

- Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements
at least once ffirstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling,
etc.l. ✅

- Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task. ✅

- Create at least one element using createElement. ✅

- Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM. ✅

- Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the
cloneNode method to create templated content. ✅

- Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to
user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.  ✅

- Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user
interactions using the style or classList propertics. ✅

- Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user
interaction. ✅

- Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated
event handler functions. ✅

- Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) propertics or methods. ✅

- Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation. ✅

- Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based
validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but
should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute
validation.) ✅

- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that
do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial
credit). ✅

- Commit frequently to the git repository. ✅

- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. ✅

- Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. ✅
